TODO RN:  
* Sort ideas by prio
* >Better naming for Condition stuff
* >Make all effects implement new refactor
* Being/BaseBeing protected?
* Proper LegalTarget(ing)
* More Applier shenanigans, not permanent modifiers, etc
  * Condition Applier (IConditionEffectComponent)
* More StackComponent Modifiers & Unit Tests
  * StackAdd Cooldown, and/or StackEffect Cooldown
  * Stack Modifiers
* Conditional modifiers
  * IBaseBeing instead of BaseBeing in events? 
* Make lifeSteal component part of actual baseProject.Being class instead
* Mutlitarget? Modifier, for AoE?
* TimeComp Slow (veno gale)
* Stats StatusTag (stats change)
* Improve modifier decision flow chart
* Unittest:
  * Value & intensity updates with time (10 linger = 1 second, 100 linger = 5 sec, 1000 linger = 20)Â±
  * Stat change removal after duration/remove effect
  * All mechanics & components
* Unity UI for controlling beings and their values, modifiers, timers, etc (check how entitas does it, can't because it's closed source...)
* UniqueId per new component?
* >Condition Apply (ex. (apply?) happens when player has less/more than 10 X(damage, health, etc)?)
  > ConditionCheck Modifier Id (add dmg)  
  > ConditionCheck Elemental Intensity  
  > ConditionCheck Has Stat  
  > Condition without ConditionEvents (only applies on X)  
  >  OnDealDamage, check health stat for owner. If lower than X, apply effect  
  >  If health on IsLow, add 50 damage, if not, remove that 50 damage  
    > Conditional enemy(acter)  
    > Value Based   
    > On low health
* >Ressurection EffectComponent? Needs to be condition based though
* Editor Window for prototypes/modifiers
