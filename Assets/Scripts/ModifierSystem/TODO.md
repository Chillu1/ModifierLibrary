TODO RN:  
* Sort ideas by prio
* >Have a go at stackComponent again
    What to do with EveryXStacks mechanic? Aka prevent someone from removing & adding stacks to get the effect. Dont let it be removable/have a high MaxStacks
    Prob dont give damage to all damageData in the whole array
* Conditional modifiers
  * IBaseBeing instead of BaseBeing in events? 
* Make lifeSteal component part of actual baseProject.Being class instead
* Mutlitarget? Modifier, for AoE?
* TimeComp Slow (veno gale)
* Stats StatusTag (stats change)
* Unittest:
  * Value & intensity updates with time (10 linger = 1 second, 100 linger = 5 sec, 1000 linger = 20)Â±
  * Stat change removal after duration/remove effect
  * All mechanics & components
* Unity UI for controlling beings and their values, modifiers, timers, etc (check how entitas does it, can't because it's closed source...)
* UniqueId per new component?
* Condition Apply (ex. (apply?) happens when player has more than 10 damage?)
* Ressurection
* Editor Window for prototypes/modifiers

Automatic tags:
    XEffectComponent inside TimeComponent with resetOnFinished = effect
    //DamageComponent inside TimeComponent with resetOnFinished = DoT
    Heal
    Stun/Slow-effect,etc. On Init = StatusType.X
    Unit test: Correct tags

Later:    
    AddTarget (when?) (init & apply need it)
