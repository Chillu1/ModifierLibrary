TODO RN:  
* Sort ideas by prio
* Conditional modifiers
* Mutlitarget? Modifier, for AoE?
* TimeComp Slow (veno gale)
* >Unity UI for controlling beings and their values, modifiers, timers, etc (check how entitas does it, can't because it's closed source...)
* Stats StatusTag (stats change)
* Unittest:
  * Value & intensity updates with time (10 linger = 1 second, 100 linger = 5 sec, 1000 linger = 20)Â±
  * Stat change removal after duration/remove effect
  * All mechanics & components
* UniqueId per new component?
* ConditionalApply (OnAttack, OnDeath, etc) (ex. explode on death, deal damage revenge, on death)
* Editor Window for prototypes/modifiers

Automatic tags:
    XEffectComponent inside TimeComponent with resetOnFinished = effect
    //DamageComponent inside TimeComponent with resetOnFinished = DoT
    Heal
    Stun/Slow-effect,etc. On Init = StatusType.X
    Unit test: Correct tags

Later:
